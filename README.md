# Rainbow Six Siege Forge Extractor

A Windows tool for browsing Rainbow Six Siege operators and exporting them to Blender.

Includes operator search, asset indexing, export, Blender 4.5 add-on installation and direct Blender launch.

*Current alpha interface. The central 3D preview and material/texture inspector are not implemented yet.*

## Standalone setup

Requires 64-bit Windows, a local Siege installation, a compatible Oodle runtime ([such as this one](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q2Bhz1jmjBFRBzsN0eS1UDMsqgDCpdXl/view?usp=sharing)) and Blender 4.5. Python is not required for the standalone build.

1. Extract the entire release ZIP into a folder.
2. Keep `R6ForgeExtractor.exe`, `R6Worker.exe` and `_internal` together.
3. Configure Oodle as described below.
4. Launch **R6ForgeExtractor.exe**.
5. Choose your game folder and Blender 4.5 executable using **Browse**.

### Oodle

Supply a compatible `oo2core_*_win64.dll` you are authorized to use. Some games using Oodle include this DLL in their installation folders, you may already have a suitable copy in a game you own. Compatibility is not guaranteed.

Place the DLL beside `R6ForgeExtractor.exe`, or set `R6_OODLE_DLL` to its full path.

For example, launch from PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:R6_OODLE_DLL = "C:\Path\To\oo2core_8_win64.dll"
.\R6ForgeExtractor.exe
```

Oodle is not bundled. See [RAD's official Oodle page](https://www.radgametools.com/oodle.htm) for product information and evaluation requests.

## Export and open an operator

1. Click **Build / Update Asset Index**. Repeat after game updates.
2. Click **Load operators**, then search for and select an operator.
3. Click **Export selected operator** and choose a destination.
4. Close Blender and click **Install Blender 4.5 add-on** once or again after updating the importer.
5. Click **Open in Blender** while selecting the exported operator.

Exports use:

```text
<destination>/<operator-name>/<body-or-head>/<model-UID>/
```

The UI remembers paths and successful exports across restarts. Moving or deleting exported files invalidates their saved paths.

Export attempts every primary group-0 model and excludes alternate groups. It stops on the first failure and retains completed files. Closing the UI waits for the active indexing, export or installation operation to finish.

The asset database is stored in `output/r6-assets.sqlite` beside the executables. Registry browsing does not require the database.

## Blender import

The add-on imports geometry and applies the existing material fixes. Ordinary glTF import does not apply the helper's shaders.

To import an existing export manually, use **File → Import → Rainbow Six Siege Operator** in Blender. Select the operator folder containing `body` and `head`.

Blender 4.5 is required by this alpha. The UI confirms that Blender launched, import errors appear in Blender's system console.

## Known limitations

- Registry discovery was checked against an installation containing 78 operators. Game updates may require parser changes.
- Caveira and Ace received visual checks. Other operators may have material or attachment issues.
- Export supports LOD0 glTF. Complete skeleton hierarchy, animations and GLB export are unavailable.
- Shaders approximate the game appearance. Streamed textures and several material effects remain incomplete.
- Interactive 3D preview, material inspection, cancellation and batch export resume are not available yet.

## Running from source

Requires 64-bit Python 3.10 or newer. Run from the project directory:

```powershell
py -3 -m pip install -r requirements-gui.txt
py -3 -B app.py
```

For source execution, place Oodle beside `main.py` or use `R6_OODLE_DLL`.

The CLI also supports archive scanning, resumable raw extraction, catalogs and model discovery:

```powershell
py -3 -B main.py -h
py -3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The standalone CLI is available through:

```powershell
.\R6Worker.exe --worker cli -h
```

Tests use synthetic data and do not require game assets or Oodle.

## Next steps

1. Interactive 3D preview and material/texture inspection.
2. Broader operator and shader validation.
3. Cancellation and resumable batch exports.
